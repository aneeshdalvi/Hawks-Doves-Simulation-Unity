# Hawks and Doves Simulation using Unity3D

This is an assignment for SER 574 solving the problem Hawks and Dove using Unity.

## Getting Started
- Run the .exe file in the ```/Builds``` folder to see the simulation

## How to Run Simulation
- After you run the .exe file, the game opens
- There are four buttons to run the simulation
   - Start button: This button is used to start the simulation for one generation
   - Next step button : This button shows the next generation of simulation
   - Stop Button: This button stops the simulation and clears the screen
   - Animate Button: This button is used to animate 100 generations of the simulation
- After you animate, you get to see two line graphs created in the data diagram over your left.
- The red line indicates - Hawks and the white line indicates Doves in the graph
- If you want to start a new simulation click on stop first and then you can start or animate the simulation to see new results.
- You can change the user inputs and see different results.
- If you do not see graph scroll out and see view it.

## Items on Screen
- Red Sphere - Hawk
- Green Sphere - Food
- White Sphere - Dove

## Type of Simulation 
Select e
- Uniform Distribution (d, r)
- Normal Distribution (d, r)
